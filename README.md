# Decentralized Signal Portfolio

The Decentralized Signal Portfolio (DSP) is an open platform that enables access to high-quality signals about a borrower's income, assets, and liabilities. These signals are collected through Signal Adapters hosted on the DSP, which gather data from a variety of on-chain and off-chain sources. Any developer can contribute to the platform by adding a new Signal Adapter for a specific data source.
