## Report bugs or vulnerabilities

If you have found a bug or identified a vulnerability in the project, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. Please follow these steps when submitting a bug or vulnerability report:

1. Search the existing issue tracker to ensure that your issue has not already been reported.
2. If your issue has not been reported, create a new issue and include the following information:
   - A clear, concise, and specific title that accurately describes the issue
   - A detailed description of the issue, including any error messages or logs that may be relevant
   - Step-by-step instructions or code snippets that allow us to reproduce the issue
   - Any additional information, such as screenshots or screen recordings, that may help us understand the issue
3. If you believe your issue poses a security risk, please do not open a public issue. Instead, please directly raise the issue with the maintainers.

By following these steps, you will help us triage and resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Thank you for your contribution!
